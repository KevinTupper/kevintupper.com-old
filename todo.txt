Me on the web

https://www.thegodjourney.com/2013/03/14/the-yuck-factor/   Ever had that yucky feeling about some opportunity, but overrode it because others might have encouraged you to do so, or because you thought it might be okay because everyone else is doing it? If so, you probably lived to regret it. Kevin Tupper again joins Wayne as they talk about our Yuck Meter going off just might be the Holy Spirit inviting you away from what human effort can produce, to open a wider door into his life and provision. That is especially true when it comes to sharing our gifts with the world. Whenever we serve our own bottom line, whether it is our thirst for money, influence, or visibility, we will find ourselves trying to monetize everything we do and slipping into the exploitive patterns of the world that may help us miss the very doors Father has opened to us.

http://www.thegodjourney.com/2012/02/10/passive-follower-or-active-participant/   Brad and Wayne couldn't find a slot to record a podcast this week, but Wayne had some visitors in town over the weekend who are long time friends and frequent listeners to The God Journey. Watching their lives grow in joy and freedom over the last decade, Wayne gleans lessons from the journeys of Kevin Tupper, Kent Burgess and Mike Rea (pictured left to right). Each talk about finding their way into a real and effective growing relationship with a Loving Father by moving from being passive followers of religion to active participants in their engagements with God. You'll learn about switching your default position from God is against you, to the reality that God is for you and find out what a quiet time really is.

http://www.thegodjourney.com/2013/03/08/myths-of-mammon/  The love of money, especially when you don't have it, can lead you to some crazy and hurtful choices. Long time friend Kevin Tupper from Virginia joins Wayne on the podcast to talk about his journey, especially how his pursuit of mammon drew him into a very dark place. But then God invited him out and in the process helped him understand the myths about money that led him astray, and how instead he could live in the simplicity of Father's care. Not only is it a great story of conversation, it unpacks Kevin's heart to help others deal with the myths of mammon and how to find yourself in a more spacious place with God caring for you.
