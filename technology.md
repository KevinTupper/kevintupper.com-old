Data and AI Cloud Solution Architects at Microsoft help federal customers understand and adopt <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/#databases">Databases</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/#ai-machine-learning">AI & Machine Learning</a>, and  <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/#analytics">Analytics</a> on Azure.  This often ends up spilling into <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/#compute">Compute</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/#storage">Storage</a>, and  <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/#web">Web</a> technologies.

It's impossible to stay current in all of these areas.  Technology constantly changes and it can be months between engagements requiring a particular prodcuct or servce.  I maintain some referecne pages to help me learn (or relearn) qucikly.
