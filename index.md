### Social networking

* [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/kevin-tupper) – if you are interested in connecting on a professional level reach out to me here.

* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/kevin.tupper) – if you are interested in connecting on a personal and social level reach out to me here.

* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kevintupper) – I don't tweet much, but I do read those I follow.  Public posts from LinkedIn and Facebook are tweeted through this account.

### Life with God

* [Christian Simplicity](https://christiansimplicity.com) - is a blog where I share thoughts about God, money, and trust and write about Mindfulness Jesus-style.  It's currently static but I am relaunching it near the end of 20202.

* [Godminders](https://godminders.org) - is a messaging service "so you always remember."  Development is on hold since I starting a new job in July 2020.  I plan to start it back up in 12-18 months.
